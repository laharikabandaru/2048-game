# 2048-game in python


Overview

The 2048 game is a sliding puzzle game where the player combines tiles with the same number to create a tile with the sum of the numbers. The objective is to reach the 2048 tile.

Features

The game features a visually appealing graphical interface designed using a Python library like Tkinter or Pygame. This makes the game intuitive and engaging for players.

2. Scores and Leaderboard

A leaderboard records high scores, encouraging replayability and competition among players.

3. Animations

Smooth animations for tile movements and merging enhance the gameplay experience.

4. Difficulty Levels

Different levels of difficulty provide challenges for players of varying skill levels. Starting configurations and additional challenges vary based on the level chosen.

5. Undo Feature

An undo option allows players to revert their last move, helping them recover from mistakes and strategize better.
